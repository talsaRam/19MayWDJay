        <li>The HTML document type declaration, also known as DOCTYPE, is the first line of code required in every HTML or XHTML document. </li>
        <li><strong>The DOCTYPE declaration is an instruction to the web browser about what version of HTML the page is written in.</strong></li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
        <li>In HTML 4.01, the DOCTYPE declaration refers to a DTD, because HTML 4.01 was based on SGML. The DTD specifies the rules for the markup language, so that the browsers render the content correctly.
